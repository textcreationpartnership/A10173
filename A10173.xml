         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For confirmation of this, though not nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to bee confirmed, and for further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in this queſtion, I argue thus: Noe men in time of controuerſie about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may with ſecuritie, and conſcience forſake the communion of the ſuperior mother and Apoſtolick commaunding church; or that is taught to haue eſpeciall aſſiſtance of God in matters of Religion: or that, vnto which to adhere by the Iudgment of the primatiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was taken for a ſuer taken of a true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, euen by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of proteſtants; to Ioyne with an Inferior, commaunded, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect church, vtterly deſtitute of ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and acknowledged by the doctors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to bee erroneous: But the Catholicks of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by forſakinge vnion with the church of Rome, and communicatinge with english pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, should bee in this conſcionles and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religeous condition: Therefore they may not doe yt. The maior propoſition, is three fold, contayning in effect three propoſitions, as the argument for breuitie, three demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue arguments. The firſt propoſition is this: <hi>The mother, ſuperior, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge church, may not vvithout greater authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee forſaken, to Ioyne vvith a ſubiect, Inferior and commaunded church:</hi> And it is euidently

               <p>The ſecond propoſition is this: <hi>That church which in the Iudgment of many hath eſpeciall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from God, and freedome from error in religion, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rather to bee communicated with, then that which by all men, euen the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of it ſelf is condemned of error, and confeſſed to be fallible and deceauing iudgment,</hi> And this alſoe is manifeſtly true: for in the firſt there is either aſſurednes; or contenting hope, to bee free from error and obtaine ſalualtion: in the other noe true hope thereof at all, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed certainetie of error, ſeducing, and to bee damned.</p>
               <p>The third propoſition is this: <hi>That church which by the primatiue fathers had that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Now that the caſe of engliſh, catolicks ſhould bee this, in all this three propoſitions, if they ſhould communicate with engliſh proteſtans, I doe thus demonſtrate by thes proteſtans them ſelues; and firſt how the romane church was, and ſtill is, this mother, ſuperior, &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge Church may appeare by the ſentence of his maieſtè, concerninge that church in this<note place="margin">K ſpeach in parlam.</note> wordes: <hi>it is our mother church: it was a rule to</hi>

               <p>Againe thus I argue: None that haue beene condemned about articles of faith, or as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks by generall councell, haue the pure worde of God, or may bee communicated with, in ſuch religeous things: but the english prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are ſuch, by their owne, iudgments: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue not the pure word preached, nor may bee communicated with in Religion.

               <p>Further I argue in this maner; Whatſoeuer is confidently taught, printed, and publiſhed, by men of Religion, is to bee allowed and graunted by all that acknowledg themſelues to bee wholly of the ſame Religion, with them, in all things eſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall: But the hauing of the pure worde preached, though eſſentiall in Religion, is yet denyde by theſe conſenting proteſtants to bee in their church: Therfore they muſt graunt it is wanting with them.

Now that the bleſſed ſacrament of the altar is wanting in their church, I thus demonſtrate. Firſt becauſe as they acknowledg, it is to bee celebrated by a lawfully conſecrated preiſt, or miniſter, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of them rather call him, yt ſelfe beinge a ſacrament of greateſt conſecration, and they haue not any ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated preiſt or miniſter in their church; therefore this ſoe ſacred and conſecrated holy ſacrament, not being without ſuch conſecration and preiſt, is not in their church, and their breade and wyne is noe more a ſacrament then that which in a tauerne is ſeet on the table by the drawer of the wine.</p>
               <p>And for this preſent it is manifeſtly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by D.

And to make this matter more euident, if it could bee, and further confirme, that theſe men want this ſacred Order and Sacrament of preiſthood to miniſter this and the other ſacraments, hee writeth of yt againe in this maner. <hi>It is a power,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Further I argue thus: The proteſtants of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by their owne teſtimonies to bee vſed in the next chapters, and as appeareth alſoe by them allreadie, are hereticks: therefore by their doctrie printed, their children are not to bee baptized: And ſoe by them there is noe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme priuate or not priuate amonge them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they onely baptiſe children.

                  </hi> Therefore by theſe proteſtant poſitions, noe proteſtants in England being either to baptiſe, or bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, there is noe Baptiſme among them, much leſſe Baptiſme duely miniſtred, which is the poynt in queſtion. And ſoe not any one ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to giue grace amonge them: therfore noe meruaile if ſoe greate &amp; prophane ſins &amp; impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties raigne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, as they teſtifie hereafter.</p>
               <p>Further: whereas it is proued, that Chriſt inſtituted all thoſe ſeauen ſacraments which bee vſed in the Romane church, with their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,

               <p>To theſe I add this argument from themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, ſoe agreing together in all materiall things ſuch as ſacraments bee: noe companie where the ſacraments bee not, or not duely miniſtred, is the true church, or to bee communicated within Religion: But the engliſh proteſtant ſuppoſed church by their owne teſtimonies, is ſuch: Therefore it is not the true church, nor to bee communicated with in Religion, the<note place="margin">

                  <hi>breache of the vnitie of the churche, the vnitie of the church conſisteth in three things. First the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the people to their lawfull paſtors.

But to proue them to bee in the higheſt degree of Sciſme, I will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke demonſtration, that they are guiltie in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge all theſe vnities. And firſt concerninge their firſt vnitie <hi>of ſubiection to lawfull Paſtors:</hi> I argue thus. At the begynning of proteſtancie either the paſtors of the Romane church na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely the Pope, when they reuolted from him were true paſtors or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they were not, then their pretended ordination and Epiſcopalitie from thence is voyde, if they were their true paſtors, then they are Sciſmaticks for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt and diſobedience vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly I proue yt thus: euery church not clayminge to bee ſupreame, the ſuperior, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or commaunding church, and yett ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting yt ſelfe and obedient vnto none, is ſciſmaticall: for not to obey a lawfull ſuperior Paſtor, is ſciſme, and their Biſhop Barlowe

               <head>The <hi>8.</hi> particular proteſtant demonstration, for Catholicks iuſt Recuſancie, is: Becauſe the publicke proteſtant Seruice, at which they refuſe to bee preſent, and communicate in, is falſe, hereticall, iuſtely condemned and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by their owne doctrine.</head>
               <p>NOw to come to their prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice it ſelfe, at which, becauſe Catholicks moſte iuſtely as before, refuſe to bee preſent, and for ſuch Recuſancie or Refuſall, are moſte vniuſtly and aboue the meaſure of puniſhment of the greateſt and notorious ſyns, excepting treaſons and matters of ſtate, punished and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, being conteyned in that their ſoe called Communion Booke or Booke of common prayers, I argue thus. Noe man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Hereticks and Sciſmaticks, eſpeciallie in prayers and publicke ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, not onely inuented and vſed, without the allowance of the true and lawfull paſtors, but directly oppoſite and repugnant to the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt ſpirituall authoritle, and iuriſdiction: But the engliſh proteſtants by their owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies before, are in this caſe: Therefore not to bee communicated with in ſuch prayers and ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Secondly I argue thus: noe new deuiſed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of prayer deuiſed by, conſortinge vnto, and in it ſelfe conteyninge and approuinge a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion contrary to holy ſcriprures, both the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>Thirdly I argue in this maner: whatſoeuer ſeruyce, rite of ſacraments, or faſhion of prayer was condemned by the beſt learned proteſtants of England, Scotland, Fraunce, &amp;c. to bee foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish trifelinge, and by reaſon apparant, to bee diſallowed, and yett was deuiſed, and allowed by the onely authoritie of an vnlearned childe, kinge Edward 6. and Queene Elizabeth a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not onely repugnant vnto the publicke approued office of our mother and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge church, the church of Rome, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the cuſtome of all proteſtant chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

The minor propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is thus proued: firſt that the english pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſeruice is repugnant vnto the publicke ſeruice of the latine, greeke, Armenian &amp; other auntient churches, it is euident by their litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, Maſſes, litanies, &amp;c. conteining the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">

               <p>Againe I argue in this maner: noe men infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and defiled with ſuch euill works, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryue, and leaue men deſtitute of grace, can haue good workes, done by grace, and in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; But the engliſh proteſtants by their owne teſtimonies before, are in this condition.
